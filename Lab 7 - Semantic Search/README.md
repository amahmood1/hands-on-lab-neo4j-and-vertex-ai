# Semantic Search

This Module is broken into three parts

1. \[Optional\] Part 0: Embedding 10K Files.  This step takes a while, so we provide the embeddings beforehand.  However, you can run this and use it as a reference to see how text embedding works in Vertex AI. 

2. Part 1: Loading Documents with Embeddings into Neo4j. This takes around 4-5 minutes to run

3. Part 2: Semantic Seaqrch with both embeddings and graph traversals.
