    "# Semantic Search\n",
    "Semantic search is [defined as \"search with meaning.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_search) It is key for effective knowledge retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to traditional, lexical, search which finds matches based on keywords, semantic search seeks to improve search quality and accuracy by understanding search intent and pulling results that match the user’s contextual meaning.  Semantic search is often used in reference to text embedding and vector similarity search, but this is just one implementation aspect of it. Knowledge graph and symbolic query logic can also play a critical role in making semantic search a reality. \n",
    "\n",
    "If all you care about is analyzing a set of documents on a file system, then sure, vector indexing and search may be sufficient.  However, once you need to retrieve and make inferences about people, places, and things connected to those documents, Knowledge graph becomes key. \n",
    "\n",
    "If documents are the entities of interest, for example: \"find all documents that talk about pharma related things,\" then text embeddings with vector similarity search suffices.  But, what if we want second or third-order entities related to the documents?  For example, \"find investors who are most focused on pharma related strategies,\" how would we efficiently search for them at scale in an enterprise setting?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what we demonstrate below.  We will also show how you can use graph relationships and Graph Data Science algorithms to further improve search results, especially in common scenarios where the presence of text data is inconsistent or sparse."
