    "We encourage you to use Vertex AI Codey family models with a schema, few-shot examples, and precise prompt engineering for Cypher generation. However, if that still doesn't provide an appropriate level of quality, or you need your LLM to improve accuracy on a more specific task area, you can try fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning is the process of taking a foundational model and making precise changes to improve its performance for a specific, narrower task. It works by taking in training data containing many examples of your specific task and using it to update or add additional parameters in a new version of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total training time generally takes more than an hour. The tuned adapter model is going to stay within your tenant, and your training data will not be used to train the base model, which is frozen. Tuning runs on GCP's TPU infrastructure that is optimized to run ML workloads.\n",

    "The training data should be structured as a supervised training set, where each row contains input text and desired, resulting, Cypher query. Vertex AI expects you to adhere to the below format in a `jsonl` file.\n",
