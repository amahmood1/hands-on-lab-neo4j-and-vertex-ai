# Lab 08 - Graph Data Science
In this lab, we're going to work with some more notebooks.

## Cypher Queries
Now that we've got Vertex AI Workbench setup, we're going to run a few queries using the python API.  Earlier we used the graphical interface in the Neo4j Browser.  We're going to do the same thing but in a programmatic way.  

Let's start by firing up a notebook.  Click on the new "hands-on-lab-neo4j-and-vertex-ai" in the file explorer.  Drill down to Lab 7 and open the "exploring_cypher.ipynb" notebook.  Start up a Python kernel and work through that noteboook!

## Graph Embedding
We're going to generate a graph embedding using Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS).  This will be an additional feature we can use to train our machine learning model later.

So, let's get started!  Open up the [embedding.ipynb](embedding.ipynb) notebook in Vertex AI Workbench.  Then run through it.
