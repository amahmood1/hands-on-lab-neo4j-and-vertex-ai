# Vertex AI Workbench

## Pandas
First off, let's fiddle with the data in pandas.  We're going to use Google Colab to do that.  Colab is a really light weight way to run a notebook on Google Cloud.  Click [here](exploring_pandas.ipynb) to get started.

## Vertex AI Workbench
Now that we've done some very light weight exploration, let's try using a more full featured environment, Vertex AI Workbench.  

## Cypher Queries
Now we'll run a few queries using the python API.  Earlier we used the graphical interface in the Neo4j Browser.  We're going to do the same thing but in a programmatic way.  Let's start by firing up a notebook.  Click [here](exploring_cypher.ipynb) and then follow the "Run in Colab" link to open it in Google Colab.
