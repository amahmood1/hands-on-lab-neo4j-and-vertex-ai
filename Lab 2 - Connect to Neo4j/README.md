# Lab 2 - Connect to Neo4j
In this lab, we're going to connect to the Neo4j deployment we created in the previous step.

## Neo4j Browser
A quick thing we can do to check that our deployment is running successfully is to open the Neo4j Browser.

## Neo4j Bloom
Neo4j Bloom is a business intelligence (BI) tool.  It's running on that same 7474 port that the Neo4j Browser was.  So, to open it up, we can just edit that url slightly by add "bloom" to the end of it and hitting enter.
