# Lab 7 - Cleanup
You can keep the resources you've deployed in these labs running as long as you like.  Eventually the credits in your account will be exhausted and they'll be automatically shutdown.  Alternatively, you can delete them by following these instructions.

## Delete AuraDB Professional Database
Login to console...

## Delete Deployment Manager Resources
Run the following command

    gcloud deployment-manager deployments create ${DEPLOYMENT_NAME}
