# Signup for Google Cloud
If you don't already have a Google Cloud account, these instructions will help with creating one.  If you don't have a Google account you'll need to create one as well.

## Sign up for a Google Account
First off, you'll need a Google account.  If you don't have one (either a company account or a gmail address), you can sign up for one [here](https://accounts.google.com/).

## Sign up for a Google Cloud account
You can sign up for a Google Cloud account [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

You'll need to provide your phone number and credit card information.  New GCP accounts come with a $300 credit. Total costs for the lab should be significantly under $50. At the end of the lab we'll show you how to delete any resources you've deployed as well.

Once you've signed up for an account, you'll see a dialog to activate your $300 in credits.  Click activate.

Provide your payment information and click "Continue."  Note this is only used to verfiy your identity.  It will not be charged unless both your $300 credit is exhausted and you enable billing.

You'll now be presented with the console again.  There may be a few help dialogs you can dismiss.

Great!  You now have a GCP account and you're all ready to get started deploying stuff!
