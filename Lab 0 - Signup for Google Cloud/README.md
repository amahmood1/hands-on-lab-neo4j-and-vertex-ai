# Lab 0 - Signup for Google Cloud
For this lab you'll need both a Google and a Google Cloud account.  If you don't have accounts or if they are restricted so you can't deploy things, you can follow these steps to create a free trial.

You'll need to provide your phone number and credit card information.  This is not charged unless you explicitly enable billing, rather it is used to verify your identity.  New Google Cloud accounts come with a $300 credit. Total costs for the lab should be significantly under $50. At the end of the lab we'll show you how to delete any resources you've deployed as well.

## Improving the Labs
As you work through these labs, we'd really appreciate your feedback.  One way to help us improve is to open an issue by going [here](https://github.com/neo4j-partners/hands-on-lab-neo4j-and-vertex-ai/issues).  Outright bugs, usability suggestions, and general comments are all appreciated.  Pull requests are great too!

If you have an existing email address you can potentially use that.  However, you'd want to be absolutely certain that you've not already used the Google Cloud free trial for that email address.  Alternatively, select "Get a gmail address instead."
