# Lab 6 - Vertex AI
Now we've reached what we've been working toward -- pulling graph data into Vertex AI.

## Importing to Vertex AI
First off, we're going to create a new dataset using our original data.  This is the data that does not have our graph features.  That'll provide a baseline for model performance.  You can do this either using the Google Cloud console or the python API.  We're going to use the python API in this case.  So, let's fire up another notebook [here](asd).
